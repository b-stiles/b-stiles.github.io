    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <p>This project explores how to create a blinking LED circuit controlled by an Arduino. 
          The goal was to design a schematic, assemble the circuit on a breadboard, and write 
          code to create a dynamic blinking pattern for three LEDs. For added creativity, I designed 
          a cascading effect where the LEDs light up in sequence, giving the impression of movement.
      </p>
         
          <h2>Hardware</h2>
          <p>The hardware setup includes three LEDs connected to Arduino pins 9, 10, and 11 through resistors 
            to control current flow. The resistor value was calculated to ensure the LEDs operate safely and efficiently.</p>
          
          <h3>Resistor Calculation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Arduino Output Voltage:</strong> 5V</li>
            <li><strong>LED Voltage Drop:</strong> 1.8V</li>
            <li><strong>Voltage = V(arduino) - V(LED) -> 5 - 1.8 = </strong>3.2V</li>
            <li><strong>Desired Current (I):</strong> 20mA = 0.02A</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance (Ohm's Law):</strong> R = V / I = 3.2V / 0.02A = 160Ω</li>
            <li><strong>Chosen Resistor:</strong> 220Ω (rounded to a standard value for safety)</li>
          </ul>
