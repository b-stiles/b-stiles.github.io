    <h1>Blink! Project Overview</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <p>This project explores how to create a blinking LED circuit controlled by an Arduino. 
          The goal was to design a schematic, assemble the circuit on a breadboard, and write 
          code to create a dynamic blinking pattern for three LEDs. 
      </p>
         
          <h2>Hardware</h2>
          <p>The hardware setup includes three LEDs connected to Arduino pins 9, 10, and 11 through resistors 
            to control current flow. The resistor value was calculated to ensure the LEDs operate safely and efficiently.</p>
          
          <h3>Resistor Calculation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Arduino Output Voltage:</strong> 5V</li>
            <li><strong>LED Voltage Drop:</strong> 1.8V</li>
            <li><strong>Voltage = V(arduino) - V(LED) -> 5 - 1.8 = </strong>3.2V</li>
            <li><strong>Desired Current (I):</strong> 20mA = 0.02A</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance (Ohm's Law):</strong> R = V / I = 3.2V / 0.02A = 160Ω</li>
            <li><strong>Chosen Resistor:</strong> 220Ω (rounded to a standard value for safety)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Arduino Code</h2>
          <p>This code controls three LEDs (green, red, yellow) connected to Arduino pins 
            9, 10, and 11.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            // Label LED pins
            int green = 9;  // Pin for green LED
            int red = 10;   // Pin for red LED
            int yellow = 11; // Pin for yellow LED
            
            // The setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
            void setup() {
              // Set all LED pins as OUTPUT
              pinMode(green, OUTPUT);   // Set green LED as OUTPUT
              pinMode(red, OUTPUT);     // Set red LED as OUTPUT
              pinMode(yellow, OUTPUT);  // Set yellow LED as OUTPUT
            }
            
            // The loop function runs over and over again forever
            void loop() {
              // Turn green LED ON and OFF
              digitalWrite(green, HIGH); // Turn green LED on
              delay(35);                 // Wait 35 ms
              digitalWrite(green, LOW);  // Turn green LED off
              delay(35);                 // Wait 35 ms
            
              // Turn red LED ON and OFF
              digitalWrite(red, HIGH);   // Turn red LED on
              delay(75);                 // Wait 75 ms
              digitalWrite(red, LOW);    // Turn red LED off
              delay(75);                 // Wait 75 ms
            
              // Turn yellow LED ON and OFF
              digitalWrite(yellow, HIGH); // Turn yellow LED on
              delay(35);                  // Wait 35 ms
              digitalWrite(yellow, LOW);  // Turn yellow LED off
              delay(35);                  // Wait 35 ms
            }
            </code></pre>

            <h2>Final Product!</h2>
            <p>The GIF shows the LEDs blinking in a cascading sequence. Each LED blinks independently 
              with unique timing to create a dynamic visual effect.

            <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
            <h4>1. Voltage Graph</h4>
              <p>The voltage across each LED alternates between 0V (off) and 2.2V (on) during the 
                blinking sequence. Below is a graph showing the timing for all three LEDs.</p>
                <img src="voltage_graph.jpg" alt="Voltage vs. Time Graph" />


              <h4>2. How many LEDs could blink with only one on at a time?</h4>
              <p>
                If only one LED is on at any given time, the current limit of 200mA no longer applies since 
                each LED would only draw 20mA sequentially. In this scenario, the Arduino could theoretically 
                control all 14 digital pins, blinking up to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>14 LEDs</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>

              <h4>3. How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you can no longer tell they are blinking?</h4>
              <p>
                When I tested the LEDs, my eyes perceived them as continuously lit when they blinked with a cycle 
                of **4ms ON and 4ms OFF**
                <p>
                In practice, I achieved this by setting the delay in the code to **4ms for ON** and **4ms for OFF**:
                </p>
                <pre><code>
                digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // Turn LED on
                delay(4); // Wait 4ms
                digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // Turn LED off
                delay(4); // Wait 4ms
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                During my tests, this configuration worked well to make the LEDs appear continuously lit, even though 
                they were still blinking rapidly. This threshold may vary slightly based on lighting conditions or individual 
                perception, but 4ms provided a reliable result.
