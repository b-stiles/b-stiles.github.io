        <p>
          This project simulates a traffic light system using Arduino. The green LED remains lit by default, representing a "go" signal. When the button is pressed, the traffic light transitions through a sequence: green fades out, yellow lights up and fades, followed by red. The sequence concludes by turning all LEDs off, and the system resets to green, awaiting the next button press.

          The goals of this assignment were to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create an interactive circuit that simulates real-world behavior.</li>
          <li>Use PWM to control LED brightness and simulate smooth fading.</li>
          <li>Integrate user input through a button to trigger the sequence.</li>
        </ul>
