      <h1>Fade Project Overview</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I designed a system to simulate a traffic light using Arduino. The green LED stays lit by default, representing a "go" signal. When a button is pressed, the system initiates a sequence that transitions the traffic light through green, yellow, and red, with each LED fading smoothly before moving to the next. Once the red light fades out, the system resets to green and waits for the next button press.
      </p>
      <p>The goals of this project were to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use digitalRead() to detect button presses.</li>
        <li>Control LEDs with analogWrite() to create a fading effect.</li>
        <li>Use a for loop for smooth transitions.</li>
        <li>Ensure safe current levels with appropriate resistor calculations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hardware</h2>
      <p>The hardware setup includes an Arduino Uno, three LEDs (red, yellow, green) connected to pins 9, 10, and 11, a 
        button with a 10kΩ pull-down resistor, 220Ω resistors for the LEDs, a breadboard, and jumper wires for connections.
      </p>


      <h2>Schematic</h2>
      <p><strong>Resistor Calculations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>LED Resistors (220Ω):</strong> Calculated using Ohm’s Law:
          <code>R = (V<sub>a</sub> - V<sub>l</sub>) / I</code>, where:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>V<sub>a</sub></strong>: Arduino voltage = 5V</li>
            <li><strong>V<sub>l</sub></strong>: Voltage for red, yellow, and green LEDs = 1.8V</li>
            <li><strong>I</strong>: Desired current = 20mA (0.02A)</li>
          </ul>
          Resulting in <code>R = (5 - 1.8) / 0.02 = 160Ω</code>. A 220Ω resistor was chosen for each LED (rounded to a standard value for safety).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Button Resistor (10kΩ):</strong> A 10kΩ pull-down resistor is used with the button to ensure the pin reads <code>LOW</code> when the button is not pressed.
        </li>
      </ul>
